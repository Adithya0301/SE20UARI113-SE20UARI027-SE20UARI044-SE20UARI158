Raspberrypi using a temperature sensor

In this assignment we have used a raspberrypi 3.0b and a temperature sensor DHT11. 
First we have connected the raspberrypi to the system using Real Vncviewer and connected the pi and system to the same wifi. Then we installed pyrebase and Adafruit_DHT modules. Now we've written a code including both Adafruit and pyrebase modules and authenticating it to the firebase taking the Apikey, URL and storage busket. Then we ran the code and while catching the sensor it was able to return the temperature readings in the firebase we have connected
